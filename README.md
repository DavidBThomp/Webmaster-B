## About
My current website has branding that isn't my favorite. I also need practice making larger sites using more scaleable optioons, along with a blog included with the site. That will be mainly to help SEO for my cliets, but in this case it is a bit more personal. I also want to track the journey, so below is more information about the steps and days as I go on making the site. Thanks for checking out my project!
