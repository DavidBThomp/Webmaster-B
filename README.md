# Webmaster-B
Remake and rebrand of DevBThom. Branding will be based around [@Amanster23]([https://www.github.com/username](https://github.com/Amanster23)) ideas. I was going to do his generic IT site but I'm feeling a bit more adventurous. I will also have to learn SASS and create my first Hugo "Theme". I say "Theme" because as a first shot I don't think this will be too modular but there will be a slight attempt. It will act more as learning chance for the first Hugo site I make.

## Project-Stack
- Netlify Deployment
= SASS
= Hugo

## About
My current website has branding that isn't my favorite. I also need practice making larger sites using more scaleable options, along with a blog included with the site. That will be mainly to help SEO for my clients, but in this case, it is a bit more personal. I also want to track the journey, so below is more information about the steps and days as I go on making the site. Thanks for checking out my project!
